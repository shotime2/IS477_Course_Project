MissingOutputException in rule analysis in file /Users/shovraman/IS477_Course_Project/Snakefile, line 33:
Job 4  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
analysis/PM25_scatter.png
analysis/Ozone_scatter.png
Removing output files of failed job analysis since they might be corrupted:
analysis/correlation_table.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
